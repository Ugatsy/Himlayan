- **Client management** — register families/representatives handling deceased paperwork
- **Contracts & billing** — lease agreements with installment or cash payment
- **Burial permits (AF 58)** — official permit issued before interment
- **Burial scheduling** — schedule, approve, and track interments
- **Deceased registry** — searchable directory of all interred persons
- **Pre-need plans** — sell memorial/burial/funeral packages in advance
- **Columbary niches** — manage wall niches for cremated remains
- **Cemetery mapping** — draw cemetery boundaries, seed grave markers
- **Pathway navigation** — Dijkstra-based pathfinding for visitors
- **Public website** — browse lots, plans, search for loved ones
- **Notifications & reminders** — installment due alerts, burial reminders

### Actors / User Roles

### Workflow: Creating a Contract

#### Step 1: Client brings Death Certificate
The bereaved family brings the deceased's death certificate to the Municipal Treasurer's Office.

#### Step 2: Staff Issues Burial Permit (AF 58)
See [Burial Permits module](#7-module-burial-permits-af-58).

#### Step 3: Staff Computes Lot Rental
- **New lot rate:** ₱2,000 (renewable every 10 years)
- **Renewal rates:**

  | Years | Individual (per year) | Family (per sqm/yr) |
  |-------|----------------------|---------------------|
  | Before 2002 | ₱20 | ₱8 |
  | 2002–2013 | ₱70 | ₱28 |
  | 2013–present | ₱200 | ₱80 |

#### Step 4: Collect Payment → Issue AF 51 Official Receipt
- Record the AF 51 (Official Receipt) number on the contract
- Payment modes: Cash, Credit Card, or Installment

#### Step 5: Create the Contract

1. Go to **Contracts & Billing** → **+ New Contract**
2. Select **Client**
3. Choose **Contract Type**: Lot / Columbary / Plan
4. For **Lot**:
   - Select the **Plot** from dropdown
   - Choose **Lot Type**: Individual or Family
   - Choose **Lease Type**: New (₱2,000 for 10 years) or Renewal
   - Enter **Lot Area** (sqm) for family lots
   - Enter **Dimension** (e.g. "2.5m × 5.0m")
   - Enter **Commencement Date** and **Expiration Date**
5. Enter **Total Amount**
6. Choose **Payment Type** (show installment count if installment)
7. Fill **AF 51 / Official Receipt** details
8. Enter **Death Certificate Number**
9. Submit

#### Step 6: Signatory Workflow (3 signatures)

The contract flows through:

```
RCC (Prepared) ──→ Municipal Treasurer ──→ Mayor
     ✓                     ✓                    ✓
```

Each approval is tracked with a timestamp. The contract show page shows:
- Green dots for completed steps
- **Approve buttons** for the next pending step
- Dates beneath each approved step

#### Step 7: Installments (if applicable)

If payment type is **Installment**, the system auto-generates monthly schedules:
- Equal monthly payments
- Due dates: 1st of each month starting from creation
- Tracked in the installments table on contract show page

#### Step 8: Download PDF Contract

Click **Download PDF** on the contract show page to generate a DomPDF document with:
- Client information
- Service details (plot, plan, or niche)
- Installment schedule
- Payment history
- Signature lines

| `issued_at` | Timestamp of issuance |
| `status` | `issued`, `used`, `cancelled` |

### Workflow: Issuing a Burial Permit

1. Client submits **Death Certificate** with proper signatures
2. Staff goes to **Permits (AF 58)** → **+ Issue Burial Permit**
3. Select the **Contract** (must exist first)
4. Fill:
   - Deceased name, DOB, DOD
   - Death certificate number
   - Burial permit fee (₱200.00 default)
   - Notes (optional)
5. Submit → Permit number auto-generated (AF58-000001, etc.)
6. **Original copy** issued to client, duplicate retained for records

### Permit Statuses

- **Issued** — Freshly printed, client has the original
- **Used** — Burial has been completed (updated by staff)
- **Cancelled** — Voided for any reason

### Rental Fee Computation (API)

**`POST /burial-permits/compute-rental`**

Parameters:
- `year_established` — Year the lot was first occupied
- `lot_type` — `individual` or `family`
- `area` — sqm (required for family lots)

Returns:
```json
{
  "type": "new",

**Routes:** `GET|POST|DELETE /paths/*`
**Controller:** `PathController`

- Visual navigation on the public find-a-loved-one map
- Waypoint management (entrances, facilities, chapels, etc.)

### Data Structure

```
PathNode (vertices)                    PathEdge (connections)
┌─────────────────────┐               ┌─────────────────────┐
│ id                  │               │ id                  │
│ name (e.g. "Gate")  │               │ from_node_id ───────┤
│ label (e.g. "Main") │               │ to_node_id ─────────┤
│ lat                 │               │ weight (meters)     │
│ lng                 │               │ path_type           │
│ type (waypoint)     │               │ is_bidirectional    │
└─────────────────────┘               └─────────────────────┘
```

### Workflow: Building Pathways

#### Step 1: Add Nodes (Waypoints)

1. Go to **Services** → **Pathways**
2. Click **draw mode** on the map
3. Click to place nodes at key locations:
   - Gates/entrances
   - Building entrances (chapel, office)
   - Intersections/crossroads
   - Facilities (comfort rooms, waiting areas)
   - Grave sections

#### Step 2: Connect Nodes with Edges

1. In **edge mode**, click two nodes to connect them
2. Weight auto-calculates using Haversine distance (actual walkable meters)
3. Edges can be one-way or bidirectional
4. Path types: `walkway`, `road`, `ramp`, `stair`

#### Step 3: Test Pathfinding

1. Use the **Find Path** tool
2. Select start and end nodes
3. System returns:
   - Ordered list of nodes to traverse
   - Total distance in meters
   - Visual path on the map

### Dijkstra Algorithm Details

The `DijkstraService` implements:
1. **Adjacency list** built from all PathEdges (with bidirectional support)
2. **Haversine formula** for distance calculation between lat/lng pairs
3. **Linear scan** for minimum distance node selection
4. Returns: `path` (ordered node collection), `nodeIds` (array), `distance` (total km)

### Export/Import

- **Export** all nodes and edges as JSON
- **Import** a previously exported JSON backup
- **Reset** to clear all pathway data

- Click to place/position burial spots
- Drag to reposition spots
- Color-coded by status: green=available, red=occupied, etc.
- Modal form for adding spot details

### Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Deceased name |
| `plot_number` | Unique plot ID |
| `section` | Section/block |
| `birth_year` / `death_year` | Years (not full dates) |

#### Memorial Lots (`/lots`)

Interactive satellite map showing available lots:
- **Green markers** = available for reservation
- **Yellow markers** = reserved (pending payment)
- **Red markers** = occupied/full
- Click a lot in the sidebar → map flies to its location
- "Reserve a Lot" button → goes to reservation form

#### Pre-Need Plans (`/plans`)

Cards grouped by type (Memorial, Burial, Funeral):
- Plan name, image/placeholder, price
- Feature list (shows first 4 + "Show all X features" badge)
- "View Details" button → full plan page
- "Apply for This Plan" → pre-filled reservation form

#### Pre-Need Plan Detail (`/plans/{plan}`)

Full details of a single plan:
- Type badge, description

- "Apply for This Plan" button with pre-selected plan

#### Columbarium (`/columbarium`)

Coming soon page.

#### Reserve a Lot / Plan / Niche (`/reserve/{type}`)

Multi-purpose reservation form:
- **Interactive Leaflet map** for lot selection (clicks synced with dropdown)
- **Dropdown selectors** for niches or plans
- Personal details: name, contact, email, address
- Additional message field
- Submits to `POST /reserve`

**On submit:**
1. Client is found or created (by contact number)
2. Contract is created with `installment` payment type
3. Plot/niche status updated to `reserved`
4. Redirect to confirmation page

#### Find a Loved One (`/find`)

Full-screen search and navigation tool:
- **GPS detection** — finds visitor's current location
- **Boundary validation** — checks if visitor is inside/outside cemetery
- **Search** — full-text search on deceased name (MySQL MATCH AGAINST)
- **Autocomplete** — search suggestions dropdown
- **Results** — markers on map with fly-to
- **Detail panel** — shows deceased info when marker clicked
- **Show Path** — Dijkstra-based turn-by-turn navigation from visitor's location to grave
- **Session state** — persists search across page reloads

**API endpoints for find page:**
- `GET /find/search?q=...` — JSON search results
- `GET /find/markers` — GeoJSON of all completed burials
- `GET /cemetery/find-path?start_lat=...&start_lng=...&end_lat=...&end_lng=...` — Dijkstra path

#### Reservation Confirmed (`/reservation-confirmed`)

Simple success message after submitting a reservation.
